# Welcome to the Pig Game Project

The Pig Game is a classic and simple dice game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain score, which is typically 100 points.

## How to Play

Each player takes turns rolling a single die. The number rolled on the die is added to the player's score for that turn. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they do not earn any points for that turn. The player can choose to "hold" and end their turn at any point before rolling a 1, at which point their accumulated points for the turn are added to their total score. 

The game ends when a player reaches the predetermined winning score. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.
